# Analysis Report

### Summary of the Dataset

The dataset `media.csv` consists of 2,652 entries and 8 columns, detailing various attributes related to media items. The key columns include information about the date of the entry, language, type of media, title, creator, and ratings in terms of overall quality and repeatability. 

#### Key Insights

1. **Missing Values**: 
   - The dataset has a notable number of missing values, particularly in the 'by' column, with 262 entries missing. The 'date' column also has 99 missing values.
   - Addressing these missing values is crucial for accurate analysis and insights.

2. **Language Distribution**: 
   - The dataset contains 11 unique languages, with English being the most common (1,306 occurrences). This indicates a strong presence of English media, which may skew insights if the analysis aims to represent a broader linguistic diversity.

3. **Media Types**: 
   - There are 8 unique media types, with 'movie' being the most frequent (2,211 occurrences). This suggests a potential focus on film-related content, which should be considered when analyzing trends and ratings.

4. **Title Popularity**: 
   - The dataset includes 2,312 unique titles, with the title 'Kanda Naal Mudhal' being the most frequently mentioned (9 occurrences). This indicates that while there are many unique titles, a few dominate the dataset.

5. **Rating Analysis**:
   - The average ratings for 'overall', 'quality', and 'repeatability' are approximately 3.05, 3.21, and 1.49, respectively. Notably, the ratings for 'overall' and 'quality' are relatively high, suggesting a generally positive perception of the media. Conversely, 'repeatability' scores lower, indicating that while media may be well-received, it is not necessarily viewed multiple times.

#### Recommendations

1. **Handling Missing Values**: 
   - Impute or remove entries with missing values in the 'by' and 'date' columns to enhance dataset integrity. This could involve replacing missing values with the mode or mean of the respective columns, especially for the 'by' column.

2. **Language Diversity**:
   - Consider expanding the dataset to include more entries in underrepresented languages to ensure a more balanced representation of media content.

3. **Deep Dive into Media Types**:
   - Conduct further analysis on the ratings segmented by media type to identify if certain types receive consistently higher ratings than others. This could help in understanding audience preferences and guiding future content creation.

4. **Review Popular Titles**:
   - Investigate the most popular titles and the reasons behind their popularity. This can inform marketing strategies and content development.

5. **Repeatability Improvement**:
   - Analyze the factors influencing low repeatability scores. Strategies could be developed to enhance viewer engagement, potentially through sequels, spin-offs, or additional content related to popular titles.

By addressing these insights and recommendations, stakeholders can make informed decisions that enhance media offerings and improve viewer satisfaction.
